1.0.2
#####

https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.OpenXml/tags/1.0.1

* Removed unnecessary required eggs.

1.0.1
#####

https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.OpenXml/tags/1.0.1

* Added Plone 2.5 compatibility. Note that ATFile that ships with Plone 2.5 does
  not attempt to index file contents. So only icons and mime types work on a
  Vanilla Plone 2.5. If you need support for indexing, consider using
  AttachmentField and PloneExFile that fit with Plone 2.5. As a consequence, the
  unit test "testATfileSearchableText" fails.

* Fixed a typo in unit tests.

  done by openxmllib in next release)

* Transform support when mime type is not provided but the filename is
  available.

  file.
